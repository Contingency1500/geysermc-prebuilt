so basically you just want to run the `playit-win_64-0.2.0-beta-rc-3.exe` file and after you want to get sent to the page where it shows your tunnel. from there you want to open a java and bedrock tunnel and you'll connect to the java tunnel with the address you see there and the port would be 25565 so for example `randomartnameexample.playit.gg:25565`. 

you want to connect to the bedrock tunnel with the ip followed by the port in the box you see so for example: `artagainlmao.playit.gg:24512` and 24512 is the port you put inside of minecraft bedrock. playit.gg basically allows you to connect without port forwarding so that's why i'm using it

thanks for reading

ok to run the server just run server.bat and connect with the ips that playit gives u. it's pretty simple don't ask me for retarded questions

ps open spigot.txt or ur retarded
